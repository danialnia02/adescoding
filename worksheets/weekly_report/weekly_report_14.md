# Weekly Report

-   Try to understand caching
-   Try find a few caching that works with both mobile and web.

## What have I done last week

-   Chose React Google Charts to display our result.
-   Create a function to alter our code into  its api to render our Gantt Chart.

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Implement the caching service into our code.

## Additional Thoughts

-   Caching was quite difficult to implement and it requires thinking on when we should cache the data at which point of the app.

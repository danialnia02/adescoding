# Weekly Report

-   Find a few framework to show our results.

## What have I done last week

-   Test both algorithmn with our database data

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Alter our result to follow the structure that the framework needs.

## Additional Thoughts

-   It was hard to understand at first on what a Framework is but its acutally self-explainatory, like in real life, the skeleton of the human body is the frame and the skin and meat is the input from the "user". Without the skeleton, we would just be like mushy goo moving around like slugs.
